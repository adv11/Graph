2) Adjacency matrix creation (Weight case with single edge between the nodes)
3) Adjacency matrix creation (Weight case with multiple edge between the nodes)
4) Adjacency List creation (normal case)
5) Adjacency list creation (with weights)
6) BFS traversal
7) DFS traversal
8) Cycle detection in undirected graph using BFS
9) Cycle detection in undirected graph using DFS
10) Check Bipartite graph using BFS
11) Check Bipartite graph using DFS
12) Cycle detection in directed graph using DFS
13) Topological sort using DFS
